stagit - static git page generator

stagit generates static HTML pages for git repositories. After
generation, serving the files requires only a HTTP file server,
making it very fast and lightweight.

Features:
  - Log of all commits from HEAD
  - Log and diffstat per commit
  - Show file tree with linkable line numbers
  - Show references: local branches and tags
  - Detect README and LICENSE file from HEAD
  - Detect .gitmodules from HEAD
  - Atom feed of commit log (atom.xml) and tags/refs (tags.xml)
  - Make index page for multiple repositories with stagit-index
  - Compatible with text browsers such as dillo, links, lynx, w3m

Security: all pages are static, no CGI or dynamic code is executed.
