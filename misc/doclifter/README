doclifter (convert nroff markup to XML-DocBook)

This package ships two Python scripts:

- doclifter translates documents written in troff macros (like man
  pages) to DocBook, that can then be converted to other formats or
  translated.

- manlifter is a mass-conversion script and test harness for doclifter.
  It can find and convert _all_ man pages in your system with one simple
  command.
 
See the man pages, or the HTML versions at:
/usr/doc/docfilter-$VERSION/html/

docfilter's author is Eric S. Raymond.

Optional runtime dependency: plotutils. This is required for
converting PIC diagrams to SVG. Not many man pages actually require
this.

To run doclifter's self-test, build with CHECK=yes in the environment.
This requires plotutils. The output from 'make check' will be included
in the package, at "/usr/doc/doclifter-$VERSION/make-check.txt".
